    "Similarly to the well-mixed SIRI model, the network SIRI model also has different dynamical regimes which are distinguished by the values of $r_0$ and $r_1$. However, while in the well-mixed case the threshold value for $r_0$ and $r_1$ was 1, in the network setting the threshold value can be shown to be $1/\\lambda_{max}(A)$ , where $\\lambda_{max}(A)$ is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix for the network. For example, for a fully connected network $\\lambda_{max}(A) = N-1$ where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph. \n",

    "The multiagent simulations have several _Advanced options_, as described in the [Command reference](#comreference) section. Try modifying the parameters to see how they change your results. Also, make sure the simulation time is long enough so that the network reaches a steady-state."
