    "This notebook reproduces and extends the results of Khaluf *et al.* ([2017](#references)). In that paper, based on an earlier analysis by Biancalini *et al.* ([2014](#references)), the authors show that non-uniform distributions in swarms of agents have an impact on the scalability of collective decision-making. In particular, they highlight the relevance of noise-induced bistability in very sparse swarm systems and the failure of these systems to scale. Their work is based on three decision models: In the first model, each agent can change its decision after being recruited by a nearby agent. The second model captures the dynamics of dense swarms controlled by the majority rule (i.e., agents switch their opinion to comply with that of the majority of their neighbours). The third model combines the first two, with the aim of studying the role of non-uniform swarm density in the performance ofcollective decision-making. Based on the three models, the authors formulate a set of requirements for convergence and scalability in collective decision-making.\n",

    "The preceding analysis was an approximation to a model of indirect switching. However, Marshall *et al.* ([2009](#references)) also analysed a *direct switching* model and argued that this decision-making model is statistically optiml for decay $k=0$. Yet decision-making in this model is pathological in the case where two equal alternatives are under consideration, and decay is zero; here a means of breaking symmetry is required (Seeley *et al.*, [2012](#references)). In fact, when $k=0$ then the uncommitted population $U$ will approach 0, and in this limit the symmetric honeybee house-hunting model is identical to the model considered by Khaluf *et al.* ([2017](#references)) but with $\\epsilon=0$.
