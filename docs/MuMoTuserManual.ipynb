The Master equation describes the probabilities of different transitions between system states. We are particularly interested in it because we can use it to derive the infinite-population behaviour of the system (the ODEs we already saw), but also the noise around that. This is done by applying a technique called the *van Kampen expansion* ([van Kampen, 2007](#references)), to approximate the *Fokker-Planck equation*.
