\subsection*{Multiscale Modelling Tool }

Repository should contain following files/folders\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mu\+Mo\+T.\+py (main functionality)
\item process\+\_\+latex.\+py (La\+TeX parser, imported from process\+\_\+latex project and updated for Python 3)
\item gen (includes submodules used by Mu\+MoT, important\+: there must be an empty file called init.\+py (with 2 underscores before and after init in the filename) in that folder, so Python can recognise the modules)
\item mumot\+\_\+files (also here the name of the folder is enclosed by 2 underscores before mumot\+\_\+files and 2 underscores after, this folder is a placeholder for temporary files that are generated by Mu\+MoT, include it in the same way as done above in the master branch)
\item Mu\+Mo\+Ttest.\+py and other demo files
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Dependencies\+:}

You need to install the following tools\+: Py\+D\+S\+Tool, graphviz (graph visualization) and antlr4 4.\+5.\+3 (parser generator). It is possible to use pip. Open a terminal window and type\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item pip install pydstool
\item pip install graphviz
\item pip install antlr4-\/python3-\/runtime=4.\+5.\+3
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Test}

To test your installation run the \textquotesingle{}Mu\+Mo\+Tdemo.\+ipynb\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}Mu\+Mo\+Ttest.\+ipynb\textquotesingle{} notebooks.

\section*{Documentation}

\section*{House rules}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Update the \href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html}{\tt Doxygen} documentation when making substantive changes
\item Update \textquotesingle{}Mu\+Mo\+Ttest.\+ipynb\textquotesingle{} to add tests for new functionality
\item Write code using Python \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions}{\tt naming conventions}
