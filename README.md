# MuMoT
Multiscale Modelling Tool
---
Repository should contain following files/folders:
* MuMoT.py (main functionality)
* process_latex.py (LaTeX parser, imported from process_latex project and updated for Python 3)
* gen (includes submodules used by MuMoT, important: there must be an empty file called "__init__.py" in that folder,so Python can recognise the modules)
* "__mumot_files__" (this folder is a placeholder for temporary files that are generated by MuMoT, include it in the same way as done above in the master-branch)  
* MuMoTtest.py and other demo files

# Dependencies:
You need to install the following tools: PyDSTool, graphviz (graph visualization) and antlr4 (parser generator). It is possible to pip. Open a terminal window and type:

* pip install pydstool
* pip install graphviz
* pip install antlr4

# Test
To test your installation run the 'MuMoTdemo.ipynb' and 'MuMoTtest.ipynb' notebooks.
