## Introduction / overview

MuMoT (Multiscale Modelling Tool) is a tool designed to allow sophisticated mathematical modelling and analysis, without writing equations - the class of models that can be represented is broad, ranging from chemical reaction kinetics to demography and collective behaviour - by using a web-based interactive interface with minimal coding, rapid development and exploration of models is facilitated - the tool may also be particularly useful for pedagogical demonstrations
