## Introduction / overview

MuMoT (Multiscale Modelling Tool) is a tool designed to allow sophisticated mathematical modelling and analysis, 
without writing equations - 
the class of models that can be represented is broad, 
ranging from chemical reaction kinetics to 
demography and collective behaviour - 
by using a web-based interactive interface with minimal coding, 
rapid development and exploration of models is facilitated - 
the tool may also be particularly useful for pedagogical demonstrations.
