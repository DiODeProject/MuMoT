# MuMoT
Multiscale Modelling Tool
---
Repository should contain following files/folders:
* MuMoT.py (main functionality)
* process_latex.py (LaTeX parser, imported from process_latex project and updated for Python 3)
* gen (includes submodules used by MuMoT, important: there must be an empty file called init.py (with 2 underscores before and after init in the filename) in that folder, so Python can recognise the modules)
* mumot_files (also here the name of the folder is enclosed by 2 underscores before mumot_files and 2 underscores after, this folder is a placeholder for temporary files that are generated by MuMoT, include it in the same way as done above in the master branch)  
* MuMoTtest.py and other demo files

# Dependencies:
You need to install the following tools: PyDSTool, graphviz (graph visualization) and antlr4 4.5.3 (parser generator). It is possible to use pip. Open a terminal window and type:

* pip install pydstool
* pip install graphviz
* pip install antlr4-python3-runtime=4.5.3

# Test
To test your installation run the 'MuMoTdemo.ipynb' and 'MuMoTtest.ipynb' notebooks.

# Documentation
Read the documentation at [https://diodeproject.github.io/MuMoT/](https://diodeproject.github.io/MuMoT/)

# House rules
* Update the [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) documentation when making substantive changes
* Update 'MuMoTtest.ipynb' to add tests for new functionality
* Write code using Python [naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)
